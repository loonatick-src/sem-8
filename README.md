Course notes etc. from my eighth semester at IITB (B.Tech EP). To remain a work in progress throughout Spring 2021.
All the notes were typeset during the lectures, and I am not proficient
with TeX, which means that there are going to be mistakes, incomplete
sections, unresolved TODOs at any given point of time. While I will ry
to resolve all issues ASAP, I could also use some help.

Issues and pull requests more than welcome.
