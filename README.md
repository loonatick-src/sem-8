Course notes etc. from my eighth semester at IITB (B.Tech EP). To remain a work in progress throughout Spring 2021.
All the notes were typeset during the lectures, and I am not proficient
with TeX, which means that there are going to be mistakes, incomplete
sections, unresolved TODOs, bad typesetting, a few rants (debugging
during lectures is frustrating) and other such things that are in no
way representative of the course content and the professors' teachingmethods.

While I will try
to resolve all issues ASAP, I could also use some help. Issues and pull requests more than welcome from those also taking these
courses.
